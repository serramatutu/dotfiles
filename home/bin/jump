# jump
#
# Add path bookmarks and jump to them
#
# Jump will look for all files in the JUMPFILES env var, and will parse them
# line by line in order, looking for jump shortcut matches.
#
# The RETCODE will be 0 on success, and the first line of output will always be
# the cd-able path. It will output "." when there's nothing to do (i.e when you're
# listing jumps).
#
# USAGE:
#   # go to a shortcut
#   jump shortcut-name
#
#   # list shortcuts
#   jump
#
# EXAMPLE JUMPFILE:
#   shortcut-name=~/my/bookmarked/path
